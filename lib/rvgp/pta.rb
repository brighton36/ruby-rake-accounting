  # In addition, this class contains the {RVGP::Pta::AvailabilityHelper}, which can be included
  # by any class, in order to offer shorthand access to this entire suite of functions.

    # Given a splatted array, groups and returns arguments into an array of commands, and a hash of options. Options,
    # are expected to be provided as a Hash, as the last element of the splat.
    #
    # Most of the public methods in a Pta adapter, have largely-undefined arguments. This is because these methods
    # mostly just pass their method arguments, straight to ledger and hledger for handling. Therefore, the 'best'
    # place to find documentation on what arguments are supported, is the man page for hledger/ledger. The reason
    # most of the methods exist (#balance, #register, etc), in a pta adapter, are to control how the output of the
    # command is parsed.
    #
    # Here are some examples of how arguments are sent straight to a pta command:
    # - ledger.balance('Personal:Expenses', file: '/tmp/test.journal') becomes:
    #   /usr/bin/ledger xml Personal:Expenses --file /tmp/test.journal
    # - pta.register('Income', monthly: true) becomes:
    #   /usr/bin/ledger xml Income --sort date --monthly
    #
    # That being said - there are some options that don't get passed directly to the pta command. Most of these
    # options are documented below.
    #
    # This method also supports the following options, for additional handling:
    # - **:hledger_args** - If this is a ledger adapter, this option is removed. Otherwise, the values of this Array
    #   will be returned in the first element of the return array.
    # - **:hledger_opts** - If this is a ledger adapter, this option is removed. Otherwise, the values of this Hash will
    #   be merged with the second element of the return array.
    # - **:ledger_args** - If this is an hledger adapter, this option is removed. Otherwise, the values of this Array
    #   will be returned in the first element of the return array.
    # - **:ledger_opts** - If this is an hledger adapter, this option is removed. Otherwise, the values of this Hash
    #   will be merged with the second element of the return array.
    # @return [Array<Object>] A two element array. The first element of this array is an Array<String> containing the
    #                         string arguments that were provided to this method, and/or which should be passed directly
    #                         to a pta shell command function. The second element of this array is a
    #                         Hash<Symbol, Object> containing the options that were provided to this method, and which
