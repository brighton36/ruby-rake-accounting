module RVGP
  # The main application class, by which all projects are defined. This class
  # contains the methods and properties that are intrinsic to the early stages of
  # project initialization, and which provides the functionality used by
  # submodules initialized after initialization. In addition, this class implements
  # the main() entry point used by Rakefiles, and in turn, instigates the
  # equivalent entry points in various modules thereafter.
  #
  # @attr_reader [String] project_path The directory path, from which this application was initialized.
  # @attr_reader [RVGP::Application::StatusOutputRake] logger The application logger. This is provided so that callers

        # There's a chicken-and-an-egg problem that's due:
        #  - users (potentially) wanting to see/trigger specific plot and grid targets, in a clean project
        #  - A pre-requisite that journals (and grids) exist, in order to determine what grid/plot targets
        #    are available.
        # So, what we do here, is do our best to determine what's available in a clean build. And, at the
        # time at which we're ready to start buildings grids/plots - we re-initialize the available tasks
        # based on what was built prior in the running build.
        #
        # Most grids can be determined by examining the reconciler years that exist in the app/ directory.
        # But, in the case that new year starts, and the prior year hasn't been rotated, we'll be adding
        # additional grids here.
        #
        # As for plots... probably we can do a better job of pre-determining those. But, they're pretty
        # inconsequential in the build time, so, unless someone needs this feature for some reason, there
        # are 'no' plots at the time of a full rake build, and the rescan adds them here after the grids
        # are built.
