  class Journal
    # This class takes a value, denominated in one commodity, and returns the equivalent value, in another commodity.
    # This process is also known as price (or currency) exchange. The basis for exchanges are rates, affixed to a
    # date. These exchange rates are expected to be provided in the same format that ledger and hledger use. Here's an
    # example:
    # ```
    #   P 2020-01-01 USD 0.893179 EUR
    #   P 2020-02-01 EUR 1.109275 USD
    #   P 2020-03-01 USD 0.907082 EUR
    # ```
    # It's typical for these exchange rates to exist in a project's journals/prices.db, but, the constructor to this
    # class expects the contents of such a file, as a string. The conversion process is fairly smart, in that a
    # specified rate, works 'both ways'. Meaning that, a price query will resolve based on any stipulation of
    # equivalence between commodities. And, the matter of which code is to the left, or right, of a ratio, is
    # undifferentiated from the inverse arrangement. This behavior, and most all others in this class, mimics the way
    # ledger works, wrt price conversion.
    # @attr_reader [Array<Pricer::Price>] prices_db A parsed representation of the prices file, based on what was passed
    #                                               in the constructor.
    class Pricer
      # This class represents a line, parsed from a prices journal. And, an instance of this class
      # represents an exchange rate.
      # This class contains a datetime, an amount, and two codes.
      # @attr_reader [Time] at The time at which this exchange rate was declared in effect
      # @attr_reader [String] lcode The character alphabetic code, or symbol for the left side of the exchange pair
      # @attr_reader [String] rcode The character alphabetic code, or symbol for the right side of the exchange pair.
      #                             This code should (always?) match the amount.code
      # @attr_reader [RVGP::Journal::Commodity] amount The ratio of lcode, to rcode. Aka: The exchange rate.

      #   This option calls the provided Proc with the parameters offered to {#add}.
      #   Mostly, this exists to solve a very specific bug that occurs under certain
      #   conditions, in projects where currencies are automatically converted by
      #   ledger. If you see the I18n.t(error.missing_entry_in_prices_db) message
      #   in your build log, scrolling by - you should almost certainly add that entry
      #   to your project's prices.db. And this option is how that notice was fired.
      #
      #   This option 'addresses' a pernicious bug that will likely affect you. And
      #   I don't have an easy solution, as, I sort of blame ledger for this.
      #   The problem will manifest itself in the form of grids that output
      #   differently, depending on what grids were built in the process.
      #
      #   So, If, say, we're only building 2022 grids. But, a clean build
      #   would have built 2021 grids, before instigating the 2022 grid
      #   build - then, we would see different outputs in the 2022-only build.
      #
      #   The reason for this, is that there doesn't appear to be any way of
      #   accounting for all historical currency conversions in ledger's output.
      #   The data coming out of ledger only includes currency conversions in
      #   the output date range. This will sometimes cause weird discrepencies
      #   in the totals between a 2021-2022 run, vs a 2022-only run.
      #
      #   The only solution I could think of, at this time, was to burp on
      #   any occurence, where, a conversion, wasn't already in the prices.db
      #   That way, an operator (you) can simply add the outputted burp, into
      #   the prices.db file. This will ensure consistency in all grids,
      #   regardless of the ranges you run them.
      #
      #   NOTE: This feature is currently unimplemnted in hledger. And, I have no
      #   solution planned there at this time. Probably, that means you should
      #   only use ledger in your project, if you're working with multiple currencies,
      #   and don't want to rebuild your project from clean, every time you make
      #   non-trivial changes.
      #
      #   If you have a better idea, or some other way to ensure consistency
      #   (A SystemValidation?)... PR's welcome!
