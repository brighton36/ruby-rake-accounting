module RVGP
  module Base
    # This class contains methods shared by both {RVGP::Base::JournalValidation} and {RVGP::Base::SystemValidation}.
    # Validations are run during a project build, after the reconcile tasks.
    #
    # Validations are typically defined inside a .rb in your project's app/validations folder, and should inherit from
    # JournalValidation or SystemValidation (though not this class itself). Your validations can be customized
    # in ruby, to add warnings or errors to your build. Warnings are non-fatal, and merely output a notice on the
    # command line. Errors are fatal, and halt a build.
    #
    # This Base class contains some common helpers for use in your validations, regardless of whether its a system or
    # journal validation. Here are the differences between these two validation classes:
    #
    # ##Journal Validations
    # Validate the output of one reconciler at a time<br>
    #
    # These validations are run immediately after the reconcile task, and before system validations
    # are run. Each instance of these validations is applied to a reconcilers output file (typically located in
    # build/journal). And by default, any journal validations that are defined in a project's app/validations are
    # instantiated against every reconciler's output, in the project. This behavior can be overwritten, by defining a
    # 'disable_checks' array in the root of the reconciler's yaml, containing the name(s) of validations to disable
    # for that journal. These names are expected to be the classname of the validation, underscorized, lowercase, and
    # with the 'Validation' suffix removed from the class. For example, to disable the
    # {RVGP::Validations::BalanceValidation} in one of the reconcilers of your project, add the following lines to its
    # yaml:
    # ```
    # disable_checks:
    #   - balance
    # ```
    # A JournalValidation is passed the reconciler corresponding to it's instance in its initialize method. For further
    # details on how these validations work, see the documentation for this class here {RVGP::Base::JournalValidation}
    # or check out an example implementation. Here's the BalanceValidation itself, which is a relatively easy example to
    # {https://github.com/brighton36/rvgp/blob/main/lib/rvgp/validations/balance_validation.rb balance_validation.rb}
    # follow.
    #
    # ##System Validations
    # Validate the entire, finished, journal output for the project <br>
    #
    # Unlike Journal validations, these Validations are run without a target, and are expected to generate warnings and
    # errors based on the state of queries spanning multiple journals.
    #
    # There are no example SystemValidations included in the distribution of rvgp. However, here's an easy one, to serve
    # as reference. This validation ensures Transfers between accounts are always credited and
    # debited on both sides:
    # ```
    #  class TransferAccountValidation < RVGP::Base::SystemValidation
    #    STATUS_LABEL = 'Unbalanced inter-account transfers'
    #    DESCRIPTION = "Ensure that debits and credits through Transfer accounts, complete without remainders"
    #
    #    def validate
    #      warnings = pta.balance('Transfers').accounts.map do |account|
    #        account.amounts.map do |amount|
    #          [ account.fullname, RVGP.pastel.yellow('━'), amount.to_s(commatize: true) ].join(' ')
    #        end
    #      end.compact.flatten
    #
    #      warning! 'Unbalanced Transfer Encountered', warnings if warnings.length > 0
    #    end
    #  end
    # ```
    #
    # The above validation works, if you assign transfers between accounts like so:
    # ```
    # ; This is how a Credit Card Payment looks in my Checking account, the source of funds:
    # 2023-01-25 Payment to American Express card ending in 1234
    #   Transfers:PersonalChecking_PersonalAmex    $ 10000.00
    #   Personal:Assets:AcmeBank:Checking
    #
    # ; This is how a Credit Card Payment looks in my Amex account, the destination of funds:
    # 2023-01-25 Payment Thank You - Web
    #   Transfers:PersonalChecking_PersonalAmex    $ -10000.00
    #   Personal:Liabilities:AmericanExpress
    # ```
    #
    # In this format of transfering money, if either the first or second transfer was omitted, the
    # TransferAccountValidation will alert you that money has gone missing somewhere at the bank, and/or is taking
    # longer to complete, than you expected.
    #
    # ##Summary of Differences
    # SystemValidations are largely identical to JournalValidations, with, the following exceptions:
    #
    # **Priority**
    # Journal validations are run sooner in the rake process. Just after reconciliations have completed. System
    # validations run immediately after all Journal validations have completed.
    #
    # **Input**
    # Journal validations have one input, accessible via its {RVGP::Base::JournalValidation#reconciler}. System
    # validations have no preconfigured inputs at all. Journal Validations support a disable_checks attribute in the
    # reconciler yaml, and system validations have no such directive.
    #
    # **Labeling**
    # With Journal validations, tasks are labeled automatically by rvgp, based on their class name. System validations
    # are expected to define a STATUS_LABEL and DESCRIPTION constant, in order to arrive at these labels.
    #
    # Note that for either type of validation, most/all of the integration functionality is provided by way of the
    # {RVGP::Base::Validation#error!} and {RVGP::Base::Validation#warning!} methods, instigated in the class'
    # validate method.
    #
    # ##Error and Warning formatting
    # The format of errors and warnings are a bit peculiar, and probably need a bit more polish to the interface.
    # Nonetheless, it's not complicated. Here's the way it works, for both collections:
    # - The formatting of :errors and :warnings is identical. These collections contain a hierarchy of errors, which
    #   is used to display fatal and non-fatal output to the console.
    # - Every element of these collections are expected to be a two element Array. The first element of which is to
    #   be a string containing the topmost error/warning. The second element of this Array is optional. If present,
    #   this second element is expected to be an Array of Strings, which are subordinate to the message in the first
    #   element.
    #
    # @attr_reader [Array<String,Array<String>>] errors Errors encountered by this validation. See the above note on
    #                                                   'Error and Warning formatting'
    # @attr_reader [Array<String,Array<String>>] warnings Warnings encountered by this validation. See the above note on
    #                                                     'Error and Warning formatting'
