    # If you're looking to write your own rvgp commands, or if you wish to add a rake task - this is the start of that
    # endeavor.
    #
    # All of the built-in rvgp commands are descendants of this Base class. And, the easiest way to get started in
    # writing your own, is simply to emulate one of these examples. You can see links to these examples listed under
    # {RVGP::Commands}.
    #
    # When you're ready to start typing out your code, just place this code in a .rb file under the app/commands
    # directory of your project - and rvgp will pick it up from there. An instance of a Command, that inherits from
    # this base, is initialized with the parsed contents of the command line, for any case when a user invokes the
    # command by its name on the CLI.
    #
    # The content below documents the argument handling, rake workflow, and related functionality available to you
    # in your commands.
